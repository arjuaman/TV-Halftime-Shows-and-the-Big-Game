Gaining meaningful insights from Super Bowl dataset using Data Manipulation &amp; Visualizations

In this notebook, we loaded, cleaned, then explored Super Bowl game, television, and halftime show data.
We visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms.
We used line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases, and we discovered that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers.
